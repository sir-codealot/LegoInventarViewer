The App parses the content of a .xclx which is exportet to a CSV and presentates it.

The CSV / sheet mus be formatet as followed:

First line: The cell descriptions
Number, Name, Bricks, Genre, Sub-Genre, storage location, Year, retail price, current price, price per brick

The delimiter is a ';' and the CSV should be UTF-8 encoded, due to show special characters like currency symbols or umlauts.
If Excel doesn't encode the file the right way use a 3rd party text editor like Notepad++ to re-encode the CSV file.

Usage:
Load the CSV by browsig ("Durchsuchen") and loading it ("Laden").
After that you should see a list of items named "number: set name" in the left listview.
If you click on one item you get the detailed information about you set (based on the available information from
the CSV) and an image of the set or set-manual. The images are loaded from the brickset.com database and are choosen
after their name convections (usually the set's number or [number]-1).
